As a **user**, I want to see a **custom 500 error page** so that **I can understand that something went wrong and be guided back to a functional page.**

- The 500 error page should display a friendly error message that explains a server issue occurred.

- The page should provide links to return to the home page

- The design should be consistent with the website
