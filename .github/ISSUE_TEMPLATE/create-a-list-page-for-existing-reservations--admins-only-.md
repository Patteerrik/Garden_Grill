As a **role** I can **view a list of existing reservations** so that **I can manage and review all reservations in one place.**

- If admin is logged in, when they access the reservations list page, then they should view all existing reservations.

- When the reservations list page is displayed, when reservations are listed, then each entry should show ID, name, date, time, and status.

- Given there are up to 50 reservations, when viewing the list, then display all reservations on a single page.
