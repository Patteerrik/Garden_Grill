As a **developer** I can **create a clear and detailed README.md file** so that **users and collaborators can easily understand the project purpose, usage, and setup instructions**

- The README includes a project overview with a brief description of its purpose and features.

- It provides clear installation steps, including prerequisites and dependencies.

- The README outlines instructions for usage, covering examples or commands to run the project.
