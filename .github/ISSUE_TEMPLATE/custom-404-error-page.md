As a **website user** I want **to see a 404 error page** so that **I understand that the page does not exist and know how to return to the homepage or other parts of the website.**

- 404 page should be placed in the templates directory.

- When a user types in a non-existent address, the 404 error page should appear.

- The 404 page must have a clear message and an easy to find button to navigate the user back to the homepage.
